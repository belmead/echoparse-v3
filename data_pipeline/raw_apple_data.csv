I subscribed to activity notifications with my old bank and set it up so I was notified by text of every transaction; immediately, not when it posted.

TravCrutc,5,"I think this app is on one of the best platforms for banking apps. I‚Äôve been a member of a few different credit unions and CACU has the exact same interface as the others minus slight differences.

Something one had that I really enjoyed was the ‚Äúmemo‚Äù feature in the transfer portal of the app. It lets you leave a note/memo noting what the transfer is for. To the developers, is this something you could consider? It was really helpful in keeping track of what internal transfers were made and why.",2025-03-26T19:52:20-07:00,Works perfectly,2025.2.2.3

I would like to see the balance of my checking account in the widget on my phone, and my wife would like to see the balance of her checking account in the widget on her phone.  If CACU won‚Äôt support multiple user accounts on our joint accounts, why can‚Äôt we at least have the option to select which account(s) show up in the widget on a per-device basis?

Reviewer65364,2,The mobile deposit is a joke. It distorts the image no matter how you take the picture. I've tried depositing a check for the past 15 minutes and each time I take the picture it cuts off a different part of the image. If I hold the camera farther away it zooms in on the check. If I hold it above the image it tilts the check sideways. It's ridiculous. It definitely needs an update to fix the bugs with the camera for mobile deposit.,2015-05-18T05:47:41-07:00,Mobile deposit,4.4.0.0

What I can deposit with the other guys via deposit online in a minute often takes multiple tries with errors or photos that don't come out as clear as they do on the same phone with the big guy's app.  

Secondly please enhance bill pay functionality so that I can edit and create both single and recurring payments from the app.  Single payment create is nice but not enough.  The ability to edit and create payees would be a welcome addition as well.
